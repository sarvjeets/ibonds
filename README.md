# I Bonds

This is a python library that calculates the historic values of a
[Series I Savings Bond](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/i-bonds/).
The historic rates are supplied via a data file which is updated every time
a new rate is released by [Treasury Direct](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/).
